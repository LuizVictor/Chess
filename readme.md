# Chess Game in Java

This is a Java chess game project developed as part of the Nelio Alves course project.

## How to Run the Code

Follow these steps to run the chess game:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine. You can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```terminal
git clone https://github.com/LuizVictor/Chess.git
```

2. **Compile the Java Code**: Compile the Java source files using `javac`. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```
javac Main.java
```


This will compile the main Java class, `Main.java`.

3. **Run the Chess Game**: To start the chess game, run the following command:
```
java Main
```


This will execute the `Main` class, launching the chess game.

4. **Play Chess**: Once the game starts, follow the on-screen instructions to play chess. You can use standard algebraic notation (e.g., "e2 to e4") to make your moves.

5. **Enjoy the Game**: Have fun playing chess against a friend or an AI opponent!

## Main Class

The main class for this chess game is located in the /src directory and is named `Main.java`. This class contains the entry point for the game and handles the game's setup and user interactions.
